üß† Summary
The current Paradiso site is a static, one-page WordPress build that lacks functionality, visual appeal, and operational integration.
The new Paradiso website will be a high-end, immersive, and fully functional experience, reflecting the real-world beauty and offerings of the club. It will provide seamless booking, ordering, membership management, and engaging visuals ‚Äî making the site a core part of the business, not just a brochure.

Suggestions Going Forward
Visual Style: Clean, immersive, lifestyle-forward with motion and tropical warmth. Lean into the aesthetic of The Elmont and The Wonderer, but soften any starkness with warmth, color, and community.

CMS (Optional): If they still want to make basic edits in the future (like updating events or menus), consider headless CMS like Sanity or Contentful.

Waiver Flow: Stripe ‚Üí Backend webhook ‚Üí Email waiver PDF/link via DocuSign or similar tool.

PeopleVine Help: Request direct connection with Rand to clarify data structure, login session handling, and available endpoints.
